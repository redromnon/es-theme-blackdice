# es-theme-blackdice

I created this Emulationstation theme as a hobby. This is a clean and modern theme inspired by the colour of a black dice. This theme currently supports basic and detailed views. I am also planning to add the grid and possibly video views in the future.

## Installing the theme

Click on the green **Code** button the top and then hit **Download ZIP**. Unzip the downloaded file in following folder : ``` ~/.emulationstation/themes ``` 

## Supported Systems
Currently, only some of the most popular consoles/systems are supported.

- atari2600
- dreamcast
- gamegear
- gb

## Usage

This theme was created on a 16:9 ratio screen, 4:3 ratio is not tested. The detailed view might look tiny on smaller displays.
Set ON-SCREEN HELP -> OFF and TRANSITION STYLE -> SLIDE for best experience.
